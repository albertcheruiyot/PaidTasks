/*Implement the dashboard to look like a real earning application with balance shown and some few statistics
In the dashboard a user is given one daily spin to win offer wherea user spins a wheel and wins(then gets added to totalEarnings and availableBalance in firestore) either 10,50,100,250,500,750,1000,1500,2000 arranged randomly. 
A new user must win either 1000,1500 or 2000 in the spin wheel but it should spin to appear it is random. This is only for a new user. For the remaining liftime spins I want it to be random.
Every 24hours/day a user will be given one chance to spin. If a user has already claimed todays offer he or she should be shown a countdown timer and detailed recent winnings. We will store only data for the most recent spin to reduce firebase costs. I do not want to spend alot in firebase costs.
Below the spin I want to have shortcuts for earn by Videos page and Survey page. The cards to be very atractive and entice users. Make the page very attractive and respond to all devices. 
At the top I should see available earnings, total earnings, total withdrawn and total completed tasks number. Remember to use firebase best practices to reduce firebase costs and make sure data reflects in realtime without refreshing whole site*/
